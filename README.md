 Mod 2 Project for Per Scholas Codebridge

## Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express js, React js, and Node js) and the 7 RESTful Routes in a simple product website.

## Technologies used
* MongoDB
* Express js 
* React js
* Node js
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Canva

## Lessons Learned

I originally overthought a lot of the logic and processes for this project like the navigation and buy button functionality. 
Keeping it simple and only included what was needed helped in the long run.

I also got to experiment a bit with UI testing. Making sure the functionality was correct and items performed as required.

### Challenges Faced
The buy button functionality was especially challenging and the initial idea for the styling too some time.


## Future Goals
* shopping cart function
* item greyed out for out of stock
* actual homepage
* modal for purchasing
